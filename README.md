🚀 Features

Add and search for books

Add users and manage their records

Print books and users in library

Borrowing and returning books

Efficient data storage using binary tree and linked list structures

🛠️ Technologies Used

C++

Basic SQL (for creating tables based on schema only, no database connection)

📂 File Structure

LibrarySystem.cpp → main project file containing all logic

Library_System.sql → an SQL schema representing the intended database structure for books, users, and librarians 

LibrarySystem_ERD_schema.pdf → ERD and schema illustrate the table relationships
